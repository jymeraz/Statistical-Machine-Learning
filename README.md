# Statistical-Machine-Learning

Various projects implementing statistical machine learning concepts

Project1 - focuses on exploratory data analysis and data cleaning/preparation
Project2 - implements unsupervised learning through PCA and MDS
Project3 - uses different clustering algorithms to classify the data
Project4 - applies linear regression and performs model diagnostics on the final model
Project5 - compares the implementationn of linear regression with stepwise selection, LASSO, ridge regression, principal components regression, partial least squares regression, weighted orthogonal components regression, total least squares regression, stagewise regression, and least angle regression using the mean square error of prediction
Project6 - implemented various variable selection models and compared them using the area under the ROC curve. Explored the associated odds ratio of the final model
Project7 - used supervised learning to train models using linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, single decision tree, bagging, random forests, and boosting.
